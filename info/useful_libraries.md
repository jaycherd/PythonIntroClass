# Useful Python Libraries for Stats Nerds

Useful libraries for scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization.

## NumPy
- **Description**: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Common Uses**: Array operations, statistical analysis, linear algebra.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Pandas
- **Description**: Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- **Common Uses**: Data manipulation, data cleaning, data analysis.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Matplotlib
- **Description**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Common Uses**: Creating graphs, charts, and other visual representations of data.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Seaborn
- **Description**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Common Uses**: Enhanced data visualization, making complex plots more accessible.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install seaborn
```

## SciPy
- **Description**: Used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large number of functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
- **Common Uses**: Optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install scipy
```

## Scikit-learn
- **Description**: Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. It is accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts, built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Common Uses**: Machine learning, data mining, statistical modeling.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Statsmodels
- **Description**: A module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests and statistical data exploration.
- **Common Uses**: Statistical modeling, tests, and data exploration.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

## Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
- **Description**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Common Uses**: Interactive computing, educational tools, data analysis presentations.
- **Install**:
```bash
pip install notebook
```
or for JupyterLab
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
